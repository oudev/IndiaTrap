India Tightens Grip on Foreign Tech Firms: Government-Backed Takeovers Raise Red Flags for Investors. #MadeInIndia #IndiaMarket #InvestInIndia  

In a move that signals intensifying state control over foreign tech operations, the Indian government has approved a joint venture involving Bhagwati Products Ltd. and Chinese electronics giant Huaqin, granting it official status under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. This decision paves the way for Indian state-backed control over vital aspects of mobile manufacturing, particularly those involving Chinese firms like Oppo and Vivo, which are under increasing scrutiny.

Government Pressure and Forced Partnerships
Amid geopolitical tensions and national security concerns, the Indian government has subtly—but firmly—tightened its hold on Chinese companies operating in the country. Recent reports confirm that Chinese smartphone makers Oppo and Vivo are being pressured to form joint ventures with Indian partners, with some manufacturing already outsourced to the Bhagwati-Huaqin partnership.

This echoes a broader pattern of state-facilitated control, resembling past strategies used by China during its industrial rise—but with key differences. Where China created an environment for foreign firms to localize over time, India appears to be using regulatory pressure and compliance hurdles to force partial exits or domestic takeovers of foreign operations.

A Red Flag
India appears to be pursuing a parallel path—compelling Chinese firms to cede operational control and intellectual property access under the guise of “local partnerships” or “Make in India” mandates. The government’s overt support for joint ventures like Bhagwati-Huaqin sends a strong signal: foreign control in sensitive tech sectors is no longer viable.

Strategic Risks for Investors
While India’s burgeoning smartphone market remains attractive on paper, these developments introduce substantial policy and political risks. The sudden regulatory shifts, compliance crackdowns, and potential for government-led restructuring of foreign assets reflect a hostile investment climate—especially for Chinese firms and those aligned with them.

Foreign investors should be wary of the trend toward “soft nationalization”—where control is not seized outright but eroded through regulatory nudges, forced partnerships, and strategic government incentives favoring domestic stakeholders.

Conclusion: Caution Is Warranted
As India doubles down on domestic control of high-tech manufacturing, but not in ways favorable to outside investors. The rising protectionism and politicization of manufacturing in India suggest that foreign firms, particularly in the electronics and smartphone sectors, may face shrinking influence and increasing risks.

Recommendation: Investors are advised to reassess exposure to India’s manufacturing and technology sectors, particularly where government interference could lead to unexpected restructuring or regulatory fallout. The story unfolding in India may soon echo the foreign exodus from China—but this time, with fewer returns.
